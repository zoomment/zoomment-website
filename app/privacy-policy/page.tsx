            The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the

          </Paragraph>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement
              with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
              which the Owner is subject;
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
              interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
              Owner;
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
              interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <Paragraph>
            In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific
            legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
            whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
            requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.{' '}

          <Paragraph>
            Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be

              such contract has been fully performed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate
              interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such
              purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
              legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant
              sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
            </li>

          <Paragraph>
            The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period
            whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as
            such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged
            to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to
            fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
            Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to
            rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
            after expiration of the retention period.
