Adobe Muse is a user-friendly tool for designing websites without the need to write code. Although Adobe discontinued Muse in 2020, many websites built with it are still active. One of the challenges Muse users face is integrating dynamic features like a comments section since Muse primarily focuses on static site design. This article provides a step-by-step guide on adding a comments section to your Adobe Muse website, enhancing user engagement and interaction.

#### Step 1: Preparing Your Muse Project

Open your Adobe Muse project and navigate to the page where you wish to add the comments section. This is usually a blog post or a page dedicated to user interaction.

#### Step 2: Adding an HTML Object

1.  From the Muse menu, select the Object menu, then choose Insert HTML.
2.  A dialog box will appear. Paste the provided comments widget code snippet into this box.

```html
<div
  id="zoomment"
  data-theme="light"
  data-language="en"
  data-emotions="❤️,😀,🪄,🥸,💡,🤔,💩,😢"
></div>
<script src="https://cdn.zoomment.com/zoomment.min.js"></script>
```

#### Step 3: Placing the HTML Object

After inserting the HTML code, you'll see a placeholder for the HTML object on your page. You can drag and position this placeholder wherever you want the comments section to appear. It's commonly placed at the bottom of content to encourage post-engagement comments.

#### Step 4: Customizing the Comments Widget

The widget can be customized to match your site's design and user preferences by modifying the `data-` attributes within the div tag. For example, you can switch the `data-theme` from "light" to "dark" or adjust the `data-language` to suit your audience's primary language.

#### Step 5: Publishing Your Site

Once you're satisfied with the placement and appearance of your comments section, publish your site. You can do this by exporting the site to HTML and uploading it to your hosting provider or using Adobe's Business Catalyst service if still available.

#### Step 6: Testing the Comments Section

After publishing, visit your site and navigate to the page with the comments section. Test the functionality by posting a comment to ensure everything works as expected.

#### Conclusion

Even though Adobe Muse is no longer in active development, your Muse-designed website can still offer dynamic features like a comments section. By following this guide, you can enhance user interaction on your site, making it a more engaging and community-focused space.
