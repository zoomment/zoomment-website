Zoomment, an innovative open-source commenting platform, is not just about fostering engaging discussions on your website; it's about doing so in a way that perfectly aligns with your site's aesthetic, audience's language preferences, and the tone of interaction you wish to establish. Through its versatile configuration options, Zoomment allows for a high degree of customization, ensuring that integrating a comments section doesn't mean compromising on your site's unique identity. Let's dive into the key configuration options that make Zoomment so adaptable:

#### Theme Customization

Zoomment offers three theme options to seamlessly blend with your website's design:

- Light: Ideal for websites with a bright, airy design, the light theme offers a clean and unobtrusive look.
- Dark: Perfect for sites with a darker color scheme, this theme ensures that the comments section melds smoothly with your existing design aesthetics.
- Black: For those who prefer an ultra-modern, high-contrast look, the black theme provides a striking backdrop for user comments.

Configuring the theme is as simple as setting the `data-theme` attribute in your Zoomment widget code to either `light`, `dark`, or `black`.

#### Language Support

To ensure inclusivity and accessibility, Zoomment supports multiple languages, allowing users from around the globe to interact comfortably in their native tongue. Currently, Zoomment offers support for:

- English (en)
- Armenian (hy)
- Western Armenian (hyw)
- Russian (ru)
- Chinese (zh)

By setting the `data-language` attribute, you can make your comments section welcoming to a wider audience, fostering a global community of interaction.

#### Emoji Reactions

Emojis have become a language of their own in digital communication, offering a way to express reactions and emotions succinctly. Zoomment allows you to customize the set of emojis available for reactions in your comments section. Whether you want to keep it classic with thumbs-up and hearts or get creative with a unique mix of expressions, Zoomment has you covered. Simply list your chosen emojis separated by commas in the `data-emotions` attribute. If you prefer a more traditional comments section without emoji reactions, leaving this attribute empty will disable the feature.

#### Contribute to Zoomment's Growth

One of the most exciting aspects of Zoomment being an open-source project is the opportunity for the community to contribute directly to its development. If you're multilingual and passionate about making the web a more inclusive space, consider contributing translations to Zoomment. Your efforts can help make the platform even more accessible to users worldwide, enhancing the global reach and usability of Zoomment.
