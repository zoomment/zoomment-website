Zoomment, an innovative open-source commenting platform, is not just about fostering engaging discussions on your website; it's about doing so in a way that perfectly aligns with your site's aesthetic, audience's language preferences, and the tone of interaction you wish to establish. Through its versatile configuration options, Zoomment allows for a high degree of customization, ensuring that integrating a comments section doesn't mean compromising on your site's unique identity. Let's dive into the key configuration options that make Zoomment so adaptable:

#### Theme Customization

Zoomment offers three theme options to seamlessly blend with your website's design:

- `light`: Ideal for websites with a bright, airy design, the light theme offers a clean and unobtrusive look.
- `dark`: Perfect for sites with a darker color scheme, this theme ensures that the comments section melds smoothly with your existing design aesthetics.
- `black`: For those who prefer an ultra-modern, high-contrast look, the black theme provides a striking backdrop for user comments.

Configuring the theme is as simple as setting the `data-theme` attribute in your Zoomment widget code to either `light`, `dark`, or `black`.

#### Language Support

To ensure inclusivity and accessibility, Zoomment supports multiple languages, allowing users from around the globe to interact comfortably in their native tongue. Currently, Zoomment offers support for:

- `en` - English
- `hy` - Armenian
- `hyw` - Western Armenian
- `ru` - Russian
- `zh` - Chinese

By setting the `data-language` attribute, you can make your comments section welcoming to a wider audience, fostering a global community of interaction.

If you're multilingual and passionate about making the web a more inclusive space, consider contributing translations to Zoomment. Your efforts can help make the platform even more accessible to users worldwide, enhancing the global reach and usability of Zoomment.

#### Emoji Reactions

Emojis have become a language of their own in digital communication, offering a way to express reactions and emotions succinctly. Zoomment allows you to customize the set of emojis available for reactions in your comments section. Whether you want to keep it classic with thumbs-up and hearts or get creative with a unique mix of expressions, Zoomment has you covered. Simply list your chosen emojis separated by commas in the `data-emotions` attribute. If you prefer a more traditional comments section without emoji reactions, leaving this attribute empty will disable the feature.

#### Gravatar

Gravatar is a service that provides users with a globally recognized avatar linked to their email address. When users comment on a platform integrated with Gravatar, their chosen avatar automatically appears beside their comment, adding a layer of identity and personalization.

The `data-gravatar` attribute in Zoomment allows you to specify a default avatar placeholder for cases where a user’s Gravatar does not exist. This ensures that every comment has a visual identifier, even when the user hasn’t set up a Gravatar. Here are the configuration options available for `data-gravatar`:

- `404`: Do not load any image if none is associated with the email hash. Instead, return an HTTP 404 (File Not Found) response. This option is best for those who prefer not to display any avatar unless explicitly set by the user.
- `mp` (mystery-person): Displays a simple, cartoon-style silhouetted outline of a person. This generic avatar is a great choice for maintaining anonymity while providing a visual placeholder.
- `identicon`: Generates a geometric pattern based on the user's email hash. Each identicon is unique, offering a personalized touch without revealing identity.
- `monsterid`: Creates a fun, generated ‘monster’ avatar with different colors, faces, etc. This option adds a playful element to the comments section.
- `wavatar`: Produces generated faces with differing features and backgrounds, providing a whimsical yet personal avatar option.
- `retro`: Delivers awesome generated, 8-bit arcade-style pixelated faces, appealing to fans of vintage video games and nostalgia.
- `robohash`: Generates a robot avatar with different colors, faces, etc. It’s a futuristic and creative option for tech enthusiasts.
- `blank`: Displays a transparent PNG image. This minimalistic approach is unobtrusive, keeping the focus on the comment content.
